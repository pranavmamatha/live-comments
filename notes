we are building a normal websocket server.
It's not a distributed websocket server.
It should work fine for number of users <10000.
I have added in memory object that will have the state of the room.
This will not work in distributed websocket servers.
For now I have created a class Store in which we are using inmemory.
Later we will replace it with postgress or reddis.
